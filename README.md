# ArticleScrapeWithReact

App scrapes all of the current New York Times articles of the day. MongoDB holds all of the articles scraped, which allows you to search articles by keyword (hint: try searching by such terms as 'Google' or 'Uber'). From here, you can save articles, and even leave a comment on them. React is used as the view layer, paired with React-Router, for a nice, state-driven, componentized, UI.
